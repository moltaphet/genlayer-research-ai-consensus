# GenLayer Research: AI-Consensus & Intelligent Contracts Optimization

This repository contains a deep-dive technical report focused on enhancing the efficiency and security of **Intelligent Contracts** within the GenLayer ecosystem.

## 🔍 Research Highlights
* **Data Optimization:** Implementation of DOM filtering strategies to reduce LLM context noise, achieving a **70% reduction in payload size**.
* **Consensus Stability:** Analysis of the `strict_eq` (Strict Equality) principle and its behavior with non-deterministic web data.
* **Security Framework:** Strategies to mitigate **Prompt Injection** using Multi-Oracle Voting and Strict JSON Schemas.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Real-world testing with a **7.4s Time-to-Finality (TTF)** benchmark.

## 📄 Full Report
The complete technical analysis, including benchmarks, attack vector analysis, and proposed "Semantic Consensus" models, is available in the PDF file:
